                <h2>Short Bio</h2>
                <blockquote>"Proceeding with honesty for the sake of human dignity is the most transcendent commitment in our short passage through this world".</blockquote>
                <p>
                    <strong>René Geronimo Favaloro</strong> was born and raised in 1923 in La Plata, Buenos Aires, with both his parents, Juan Manuel Favaloro and Ida Raffaelli de Favaloro. 
                    He was always committed to knowledge, thanks in part to his maternal grandmother, who transmitted her love for nature and the emotion to see when the seeds began to bear fruit.
                    He would dedicate his doctorate thesis to her: "To my grandmother Cesárea, who taught me to see beauty even in a poor dry branch".
                    <br>
                    In 1936 he began his secondary studies at the Rafael Hernández National School; After this stage, he entered the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the National University of La Plata. 
                    In the third year, he began internships at the Polyclinic Hospital and began to make contact with patients for the first time. 
                    Exceeding what was required by the program, he returned in the afternoons to monitor the progress of the patients and talk with them.
                    <br>
                    He also observed the sixth-year students of Rodolfo Rossi or Egidio Mazzei, full professors of the Medical Clinic, and also witnessed the surgeries of José María Mainetti and Federico EB Christmann, 
                    who taught him simplification and standardization techniques which he later applied in the cardiovascular surgery, its contribution to the operations of the heart and the great arteries.
                    <br>
                    He became interested in cardiovascular interventions, which were beginning to be developed at that time, and in thoracic surgery. He began to see how to finish his stage as a rural doctor and train in the United States, professors José María Mainetti and Alfonso Roque Albanese advised him at the Cleveland Clinic. 
                    In 1962 he settled in Cleveland (even with limited English speaking) and served first as a resident and then on the surgical team in collaboration with local doctors, concentrating his work on valve and congenital diseases. 
                    Later, he became interested in other topics, such as coronary angiography and the study of the anatomy of the coronary arteries and their relationship with the heart muscle.
                    <br>
                    Every day, as soon as he finished his work in the surgery room, Favaloro spent hours and hours reviewing coronary angiography and coronary angiography and studying the anatomy of the coronary arteries and their relationship with the heart muscle. 
                    The laboratory of Dr. Mason Sones, father of coronary arteriography, had the largest collection of coronary angiography in the United States. At the beginning of 1967 he studied the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery, practicing with his ideas in May of that year. 
                    The standardization of this technique, called bypass or myocardial revascularization surgery, was the main work of his career, which gave him international prestige, since the procedure radically changed the history of coronary disease. In 1970 he edited a book called Surgical treatment on coronary arteriosclerosis, which was also published in Spanish under the name Treatment of coronary arteriosclerosis surgery.
                    <br>
                    Favaloro returned to Argentina, with the idea of ​​developing a center of excellence similar to that of the Cleveland Clinic, combining medical care, research and education, as he stated in his resignation letter.
                    In 1971 he returned to Argentina, to operate at the Güemes Sanatorium in the Federal Capital, which was led by Mauricio Barón as president of the institution and by Dr. Luis de la Fuente, in cardiology as an expert in clinical cardiology and in the incipient invasive cardiology.
                    <br>
                    By the year 2000, Argentina was submerged in an economic and political crisis. The Favaloro Foundation was in a difficult situation, as a creditor of large debts of PAMI and other social works, and indebted at about 18 million US dollars. For this reason, Favaloro asked the Argentine government for help, without receiving an official response.
                    On July 29, 2000 - the same day as the birthday of his friend and cardiologist Luis de la Fuente (1932-), who had convinced him to return to Argentina - Favaloro locked himself in the bathroom of his house and shot himself through the heart.
                    <br><br>
                    After the fatal outcome, it was learned that Favaloro had left seven letters in his department, the content of which was partially revealed. In one of them, addressed to the "competent authorities", he made it clear that he had decided to take his own life, and explained that The economic crisis that the Favaloro Foundation was going through had been the trigger for its determination, 
                    expressing that Argentine society needed his death to become aware of the problems in which it was involved. Favaloro expressed his weariness of "being a beggar in his own country"
